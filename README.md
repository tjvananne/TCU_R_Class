# TCU_R_Class

Hello TCU students! This repository will be the home to all the materials we will be covering in Dr. Preston's BI class. You'll have access to these materials in class via a web browser (via Amazon Web Services, for those who are curious), but feel free to clone/download this repo to your personal computer as well!


## External Resources

It is not feasible to learn R in only an hour or two of a classroom setting. If you are interested in learning more about R, then feel free to check out these free resources:

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* [Text Mining with R](http://tidytextmining.com/)
* [Data camp - some content might not be free](https://www.datacamp.com/onboarding/learn?from=home&technology=r)
* [Data Science track in Coursera (this is how I started - you'll have to audit courses for free access)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)


## Other important skills I didn't have time to mention

* Linux -- many web and data science tools only run on Linux; and if you want to deploy anything you build, you'll likely need to know at least the basics of linux
* Python -- not all problems are best solved in R
