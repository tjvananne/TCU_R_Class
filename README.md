# TCU_R_Class
Hello TCU students! This repository will be the home to all the materials we will be covering in Dr. Preston's BI class. You'll have access to these materials in class via a web browser (via Amazon Web Services, for those who are curious), but feel free to clone/download this repo to your personal computer as well!
